# Python_dragons_and_demons
The purpose of this repository is to store and share the Python code that I wrote as part of an off-platform project through a paid online course. 
FYI: Even though I wrote all of the code myself, I didn't want it to pop-up too easily if people search for a solution, so I changed the name of the game and file.
